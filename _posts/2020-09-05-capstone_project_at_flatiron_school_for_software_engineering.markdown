It has been a long, but very fun and exciting journey to get this point but I finally completed my capstone project for Software Engineering at the Flatiron School. The project was built using React, Redux, HTML, CSS, with a Ruby on Rails API for the backend. I built a card matching game where the user has to memorize the position of all the pairs of cards on the screen before flipping them over and having to match them. A user gains 10 points for every correct, and loses 10 points for every wrong answer. A user will start with 100 points to simulate an IQ score and if they match all 10 pairs correctly they can get a perfect IQ score of 200! I had a really fun time creating this project because this was the first time I really got into CSS to make the project look just the way I wanted it to for a user. It was nice to be able to control every tiny aspect of the website so I could give the user the experience of using a clean website. I also really enjoyed using React and I am looking forward to working on future projects that use React. React seamlessy incorporates JavaScript and HTML and I think that is a really great concept because it creates codes that would make sense to even the everyday computer user. Similar to how Ruby is could be read to the average computer user and they would be able to understand what is going on, I feel as though React is the same way. I am looking forward to now working on my portfolio website as well as creating a website for my girlfriend for her business!
