I just finished creating my Ruby on Rails project where I created a website that allows users to create accounts and post/ view various home remedies they know for illnesses. I had a really great time working on this project from start to finish. Creating a website like this has a lot of moving parts that all work together, and it is really fun trying to get everything to work fluidly. I used the Ruby bcrypt gem to give my users secure passwords. ActiveRecord was used to handle the database and all the relationships between my models of user, remedy, category, and comment. The omniauth gem was used to allows users to sign up/ sign in for an account on my website using Github. I'm really glad how the website turned out and I feel as though it has a good flow. Even though the aesthetics aren't the greatest because I am not using JavaScript and React/ Redux yet, I will be learning these tools next, the website has a very professional flow and I am proud of the work.
