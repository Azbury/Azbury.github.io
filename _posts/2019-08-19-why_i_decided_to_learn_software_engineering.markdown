I decided to learn software engineering because of my love for computers. I have always loved working with computers and playing video games and I wanted to be able to create projects of my own for the world to use. I took my 1st programming class in high school in the 10th grade and I pretty much knew from there that this is what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Whenever I tell people what programming is like I always describe it like you are building a puzzle. You know what you want the end product to be, you just need to figure how to get there, one of the main concepts behind Test Driven Development. I love math and solving problems, I want to be able to take those skills into the workplace and write code that can be used by people everyday.
