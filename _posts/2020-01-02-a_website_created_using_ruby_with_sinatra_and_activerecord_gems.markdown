I recently created a website using Ruby with the Sinatra and ActiveRecord Gems. The website allows a user to create an account. When a user wants to sign in then it goes through an authentication process using a secure password to allow the user to sign in. A user can make a listing for an item for sale with a title, description, and a price. The user can then edit and delete the item after they create it. Logged in users can also view the items for sale created by other users. This was the first time I have ever created a fully functioning website entirely on my own and I can say that it was definitely a fun and great experience. It was nice to go back after I had the basic functionality of the website working to make everything look nicer and add hyperlinks to make it more like a modern day website. I enjoyed the process of learning how to create a website and I look forward to the future projects I will be working on.
