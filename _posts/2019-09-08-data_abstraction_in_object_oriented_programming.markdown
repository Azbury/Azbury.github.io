Data abstraction is a concept that is at the heart of object oriented programming. It is the idea that a program should be able encapsulate data in objects, and the data is able to be manipulated by methods of the object. The key is that the user should be able to manipulate data successfully without knowing the inner workings of the method. The user doesn't need to know how an array is sorted into alphabetical or numerical order, but when they call array.sort, the array is sorted perfectly. This is a fundamental concept in object oriented programming where a user has limited visibility, but full functionality in a program. When someone is using Twitter and they decide they want to make a new post, they don't need to know how after clicking the post button their personalized post is visible to everyone on the internet and will pop up in everyone's feed who follows them. They just need to know that the Tweet has gone global and can look forward to all of their likes and retweets popping up in their notifications.
