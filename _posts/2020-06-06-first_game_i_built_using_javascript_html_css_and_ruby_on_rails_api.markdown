When I started out on this project I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to figure out how to build a game properly from scratch. There was so much I didn't know how to do and I knew it was going to be an adventure trying to figure it all out. I was going to build a game that would help someone practice their aim for online shooting video games. Objects were going to appear on the screen and then the user would click on them to gain points. I knew what I wanted to do but no idea how to implement it. I started by just creating the basic functionality that a user could enter their username. Once moving onto the game board I ran into an issue where if you create a canvas object you can no longer click on the objects within the canvas because they are now pixels instead of HTML elements. I decided to ditch the canvas idea and implement the game board so that it was just a black background and the HTML elements that would click on would live inside the <div> tag of the game board. That worked exactly how I planned an from there on out it was smooth sailing. This was one of the most fun projects I have ever built in my 5 years learning to be a programmer. It was very satisify when I saw that first creeper appear on the game board and I was able to click it. Being a game developer would be a dream job for because I have loved video games for as long as I can remeber, but I know how competitive the industry is. Hopefully one day I can become a professional game developer and bring people joy, just like video games have brought me for countless years.
